# Test AI response (development only)
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/testing/test-sms-bot" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What are your pricing plans?"}'

# Test calendar parsing
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/testing/test-sms-calendar" \

## 🤖 **How the SMS Bot Works**

### **Customer Experience:**

```
Customer: "Hi, what are your pricing plans?"
Bot: "Hi! We have mobile ($4.99/week) and business plans (starting $49.99/month). Which interests you?"

Customer: "Tell me about the business plan"
Bot: "Business plans: Basic $49.99/mo (20 calls/week), Pro $99/mo (50 calls/week), Enterprise $299/mo (unlimited). Which interests you?"

Customer: "Can we schedule a demo tomorrow at 2pm?"
Bot: "Let me check our calendar... Great! 2pm tomorrow is available. Shall I book the 30-min demo for you?"

Customer: "Yes, book it"
Bot: "✓ Demo scheduled for Tuesday, Dec 12 at 2:00 PM! What email should I send the invite to?"
```

### **Technical Flow:**

1. **SMS Received** → Twilio webhook → `/sms/webhook`
2. **Security Check** → Validate Twilio signature
3. **Rate Limiting** → Check customer hasn't exceeded limits
4. **Conversation Lookup** → Get/create conversation record
5. **AI Processing** → Generate response with business context
6. **Calendar Check** → Handle scheduling requests if detected
7. **Response** → Send TwiML response back to customer
8. **Notification** → Optionally alert you via SMS
9. **Analytics** → Update lead scoring and conversation stats
