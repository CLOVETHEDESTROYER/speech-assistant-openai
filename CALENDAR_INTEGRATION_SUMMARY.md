# üìÖ Google Calendar Integration - Implementation Summary

## üéØ **Overview**

Successfully implemented **real-time Google Calendar integration** for voice calls using OpenAI's function calling capability. The AI agent can now create calendar events during live calls with intelligent conflict detection and employee-based booking limits.

## ‚úÖ **What's Working**

### **1. Real-Time Calendar Event Creation**

- AI agent calls `createCalendarEvent` function during voice calls
- Events are created directly in user's Google Calendar
- Proper RFC3339 datetime formatting with timezone support
- Rich event descriptions with customer information

### **2. Conflict Detection & Prevention**

- **Perfect conflict detection**: API correctly identifies overlapping events
- **Employee-based booking limits**: Configurable policies (strict, flexible, unlimited)
- **Smart conflict resolution**: AI suggests alternative times when conflicts occur
- **Detailed conflict messages**: Shows existing events and booking limits

### **3. Booking Configuration System**

- **Database model**: `UserBusinessConfig` with employee booking fields
- **API endpoints**: GET/PUT `/booking/config` for configuration management
- **Default settings**: 1 employee, strict policy, max 1 concurrent booking

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Schema Updates**

```sql
-- Added to user_business_configs table
employee_count INTEGER DEFAULT 1
max_concurrent_bookings INTEGER DEFAULT 1
booking_policy VARCHAR DEFAULT 'strict'
allow_overbooking BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
```

### **API Endpoints**

#### **Calendar Tools (AI Function Calling)**

- `POST /tools/createCalendarEvent` - Real-time event creation
  - **Input**: Event details (summary, start/end times, customer info)
  - **Output**: Success/conflict response with detailed information
  - **Conflict Detection**: Checks existing events against booking limits

#### **Booking Configuration**

- `GET /booking/config` - Get current booking settings
- `PUT /booking/config` - Update booking policies and limits
- `GET /booking/config/help` - Get configuration help and examples

### **OpenAI Session Configuration**

```python
# Calendar tools are automatically added when calendar_enabled=True
tools = [{
    "type": "function",
    "name": "createCalendarEvent",
    "description": "Create a new calendar event when the user wants to schedule something",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Title of the calendar event"},
            "start_iso": {"type": "string", "description": "Start time in RFC3339 format"},
            "end_iso": {"type": "string", "description": "End time in RFC3339 format"},
            "timezone": {"type": "string", "description": "IANA timezone", "default": "America/Denver"},
            "customer_name": {"type": "string", "description": "Name of the person booking"},
            "customer_phone": {"type": "string", "description": "Phone number"},
            "attendee_email": {"type": "string", "description": "Email for calendar invite"},
            "location": {"type": "string", "description": "Appointment location"},
            "notes": {"type": "string", "description": "Additional notes"}
        },
        "required": ["summary", "start_iso", "end_iso"]
    }
}]
```

## üéØ **User Experience Flow**

### **Successful Booking**

1. **Customer calls** ‚Üí AI agent answers
2. **Customer requests booking** ‚Üí AI collects details (name, date, time, service)
3. **AI calls createCalendarEvent** ‚Üí System checks for conflicts
4. **No conflicts found** ‚Üí Event created successfully
5. **AI confirms booking** ‚Üí "You're all set for Tuesday at 2:00 PM!"

### **Conflict Resolution**

1. **Customer requests booking** ‚Üí AI collects details
2. **AI calls createCalendarEvent** ‚Üí System detects conflict
3. **Conflict response** ‚Üí "That time is already booked (3/1 slots filled)"
4. **AI suggests alternatives** ‚Üí "I can do Wednesday at 2:00 PM instead"
5. **Customer agrees** ‚Üí AI books alternative time

## üìä **Booking Policies**

### **Strict Policy (Default)**

- **Single employee businesses**
- **1 booking per time slot maximum**
- **No overbooking allowed**
- **Perfect for solo practitioners**

### **Flexible Policy**

- **Multiple employees**
- **Configurable concurrent bookings**
- **Up to employee limit**
- **Good for small teams**

### **Unlimited Policy**

- **No restrictions**
- **Overbooking allowed**
- **For high-volume businesses**

## üîç **Testing Results**

### **Conflict Detection Test**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5051/tools/createCalendarEvent" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "summary": "Test Event",
    "start_iso": "2025-09-03T16:00:00-06:00",
    "end_iso": "2025-09-03T16:30:00-06:00",
    "user_id": 1
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "conflict",
  "error": "Time slot is not available",
  "conflicting_events": [
    "'super fun time' at 2025-09-03T16:00:00-06:00",
    "'Basic Package: Carlos' at 2025-09-03T16:00:00-06:00",
    "'Ice Cream Taco Package for Carlos' at 2025-09-03T16:00:00-06:00"
  ],
  "current_bookings": 3,
  "max_concurrent_bookings": 1,
  "booking_policy": "strict",
  "message": "Sorry, that time slot is already booked (3/1 slots filled)"
}
```

### **Live Voice Call Test**

- ‚úÖ **AI agent called calendar tool** during voice call
- ‚úÖ **Conflict detected correctly** - 3 existing events at 4:00 PM
- ‚úÖ **AI handled conflict gracefully** - told customer time was taken
- ‚úÖ **Successful rebooking** - booked for next day at same time
- ‚úÖ **Call completed properly** - no timeout issues

## üõ†Ô∏è **Recent Fixes Applied**

### **1. Scenario Prompt Update**

**Before:**

```
"If a caller asks to book, collect their name, contact info, event details, and package preference, then offer to connect them with a real person if needed."
```

**After:**

```
"When a caller wants to book an appointment, collect their name, contact info, event details, and package preference, then use the createCalendarEvent tool to schedule the appointment directly. Only offer to connect them with a real person if there are scheduling conflicts or special requirements."
```

### **2. Enhanced Error Handling**

- Added robust JSON parsing with fallback handling
- Better logging for debugging function call arguments
- Graceful handling of malformed AI responses

### **3. Database Model Fixes**

- Fixed malformed `UserBusinessConfig` model fields
- Proper employee booking configuration columns
- Removed duplicate fields
