# App Store Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the critical App Store integration changes implemented to ensure your iPhone app meets Apple's App Store requirements for in-app purchases and subscription management.

## Critical Changes Made

- Handles automatic retry for wrong environment receipts
- Extracts subscription information from validated receipts
- Prevents duplicate transaction processing

### 2. **Server-to-Server Notifications** ✅
